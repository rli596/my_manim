# My manim animations!
Welcome, this is the repo for my manim animations.

The structure of the repo is as follows: the directory manim contains separate directories corresponding to different projects.

Each project directory contains: 
* a utilities script containing functions needed for animations, called *_utils.py. 
* an animations script (possibly multiple) containing different manim scenes
* a media directory containing media produced by the animation script(s). This is created automatically by manim.

You will need ManimCE (Community Edition) in order to run manim on the scripts. The instructions for installation can be
found at https://www.manim.community/.

I hope you have fun testing these out!

Accompanying explanations for these animations can be found at my website, https://rl596.user.srcf.net/.
