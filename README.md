# My manim animations!
Welcome, this is the repo for my manim animations.

My interests are mainly in mathematical physics but somehow all the animations I have made so far have been pretty differential geometric in flavour. I currently have separate directories for animations on the theme of:
* The Lie algebra of SO(3)
* The Hopf fibration
* The Lorentz and MÃ¶bius groups
* Assorted tester animations
I hope you have fun testing these out!
